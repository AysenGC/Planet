Data Science/ML/DL Career Strategy Plan

Step One (1st Month): 

Career interests, which companies, which sector
Possible, realistic paths in data science
Gains from educational experiences, gains from internships/jobs
Visualizing myself as a successful data scientist and redefining myself, personal story, my skills, capabilities
Updating my Linkedin profile according to Silicon Valley standards
Preparing for possible interview questions(tech, behavioral, etc), 4-5 questions every day.
Start engaging in the community, reach out to people to get advice about data science careers and opportunities in their companies
Connections for a volunteer project
Cold messages to alumni working for companies that I am interested in (I already have a list of companies)

Step Two(2nd Month):

Prep for an DS/ML interview
Preparing for possible interview questions(tech, behavioral, etc), continue with  4-5 questions every day.

Donâ€™t underestimate yourself, reflect this to my language(Very important!!)
Communication is the key, work on confidence, body language, talking to camera

Step 3(3rd Month):

Polish Github, explain projects clearly
Make mock interviews with friends with computer science & engineering background @ Fb, Pinterest
Make great projects with detailed explanation and visualization

Step 4(4th Month):

I am aiming for finishing this bootcamp at the end of June. 
Resume update, bring it to the last stage.
Github update, include the volunteer work if there is no concern about data  privacy
I am a great data scientist and my answers to my interview questions are fluent at the end of 4th month. 
During 4th month, I am having lots of fun from being ready and confident
Mock interview with my coach and working on the feedback
